^Description^
-----------

This program carries out permutation tests by a Monte Carlo method. It calls
another Stata program (the "slave" program) repetitively, randomly permuting 
the values in one variable between calls. The slave program must be an ^rclass^
program and any of the returned values may be taken as a test statistic. 
Several returned values may be monitored in the same run if required. 
Optionally a restricted permutation can be carried out by permuting 
values within groups defined by one or more stratifying variables.

The program counts the number of times the test statistic(s) monitored is 
equal to or greater than its value realised in the original data.

If the data form "clusters" of related records, the permutation test is
carried out by randomly permuting values of a variable, which must be constant 
within cluster, between clusters.

The optional varlist is passed to the ^called^ program, as are weights and 
all additional options.


^Options^
-------

^program^	Name of the slave program, which must be an rclass program 
^permute^	Variable whose values are to be permuted
^tests^		The names of the returned values to be used as test statistics

The above "options" are mandatory. The remainder are optional:

^number^	Number of random permutations to carry out (default 1000)
^within^	The variables defining a stratification for permutation
^cluster^	The variables defining clusters of observations
^noisily^	Call the slave program "noisily"
^saving^	Save the test statistic values for each permutation to a Stata
                dataset
^replace^	Set if this is to replace an existing dataset
^dots^		Write a dot to the screeen every so often
^every^		Sets how often to write a dot (default 10 permutations)
